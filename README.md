Space Invaders


Ayan Basu & Adrian Jeyakumar


Our game will have an overlying mission of the user playing as a spaceship to destroy as many of the approaching invaders as possible. The slide potentiometer will be used to shift the location of the spaceship horizontally and a button will be used to launch the lasers that will take down each invader. As the game proceeds, a score will be kept, incrementing each time an invader has been shot by a laser. The game ends once all of the invaders have been taken down indicating a successful mission, or once an invader has reached the bottom of the screen taking over the user’s base indicating a loss. Another button will be incorporated to allow the user to pause and restart the game at their leisure.
